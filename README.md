# Poppy-PGen
This is Poppy, the password generator.
Poppy can generate most secure passwords which hackers won't be able to crack even in a million years.
Passwords generated by Poppy is valid throughout the internet.
Poppy has some great features and more to come in future.
Right now Poppy can generate a super secure 10 digit password and you can also generate a secure password of your custom length.

Not only Poppy generates super secure passwords but it also saves them locally for you to access it later you can also write a remark or description for each password saved in file.
but all this is just a beginning. I encourage to anyone who is willing to modify/change or add new features in this program just fork it and send a pull req.
